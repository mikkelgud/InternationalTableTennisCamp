              We will arrange travels with ITTCamp leaders from 2 airports. 
              So remember to tell us from which airport you want to travel from.
              The two airports we arrange traveling company from is:
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <ol>
              <li>Gardemoen, Norway</li>
              <br/>
              <li>Castrup, Denmark</li>
              </ol>

              <br/>
              <StyledText>
              We recomend you to let us buy the flight tickets so we can arrive at the same time. 
              We will also arrange the travel from the airport to the camp hotel (Included in camp price).
              If you want to buy the ticket yourself that's okey, but we need to be informed about this. 
              Then you confirm your sign up by deposit 2000 Kroners to ittcamp. 
              If you choose this you also have to pay the travel to the hotel yourself (We will of course help you to arrange the travel). 
             If we buy your ticket this will be done after we receive the 7000 kroners for the ticket.
               If the ticket is cheaper than 7000,
               the rest will count as a part of the payment of the camp.
               If the ticket is more expensive we will pay the rest for you. 
               So no worries, the ticket is a maximum of 7000 for you (Of course both ways).

                  The travel is aprox 16 hours. So we recomend you to bring books, headset, 
                  powerbanks and other stuff that may make the time go faster.
                  Maybe write down something you want to improve during your stay in Taiwan.
                  If you travel with the group, try to spend time getting to know each other.
                  And please, remember your passport.
