                In the beginning of the camp we will divide the Participants into groups or teams.
                These teams will after the afternoon practice play team games and have small funny competitions, as well as taking care of each other.
               This is a good way for the players to get to know each other, and for everyone to find new friends.
               <br/>
               <br/>
             <StyledH3>Meals</StyledH3>
             We will go to restaurants and eat lunch and dinner every day (This is covered in the camp price).
             It's gonna be a great time to experience the culture and food with your new friends.
             We will also go to western restaurants, but be ready for everything ðŸ˜‰.

             <br/>
        
            <StyledH3>Meetings</StyledH3>
        After every practice, we will have small group talks to sum up the practises.
        During these conversations everyone will get the chance to tell about their experience during the practices.
        We belive that open honest conversations is the best way for making progress and to make a good enviorment.
        <br/>
        In some evenings we will look at table tennis matches on a big screen with the coaches telling what we can learn from the different matches.
        We will also spend some time working on the mental aspect of the game, and talk about tactics and mentality of the world-class players.
        Li Fen will also hold lectures based on her many experiences as a world-class player for many years.
        <br/>

        <StyledH3>Tournament</StyledH3>
        <StyledText>
            The last day we will have a tournament, more information will come at the camp.
            We are aiming to make it as realistic as possible so everyone can practice how to handle pressure and other mental topics they have learned during the camp.
            <br/>
            <br/>
        It will be a lot of fun! hope to see you in Tao Yuan ðŸ˜Š
