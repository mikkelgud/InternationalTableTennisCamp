                In the beginning of the camp we will divide the Participants into teams.
                Every evening, the teams will compete in team games and fun competitions.
               This is a good way for the players to get to know each other, and for everyone to find new friends.

        After every practice, we will have small group talks to summarize the practise.
        During these conversations everyone will get the chance to talk about their experience during the practice.
        We believe that open honest conversations is the best way to make progress and to create a good enviorment.

        In the evenings we will watch table tennis matches on a big screen while the coaches analyze what you can learn from the different matches.
        We will also spend some time working on the mental aspect of the game, and talk about the tactics and mentality used by world-class players.
        Li Fen will also hold lectures based on her experiences as a world-class player for many years.

            The last day we will have a tournament, more information will come at the camp.
            We are aiming to make it as realistic as possible so everyone can practice how to handle pressure and other mental aspects learned during the camp.

        It will be a lot of fun! We hope to see you in Harestua ðŸ˜Š
